// Binary Representation
/*
What is the input to the program?
  A number
What is the output of the program?
  A binary representation of that number
What is the input to each recursive call?
  An instance of anagrams() with a permutation of the remaining string
What is the output of each recursive call?
  ''

Write a recursive function that prints out the binary
representation of a given number. For example, the 
program should take 3 as an input and print 11 as output, 
or 25 as an input and print 11001 as an output. Note 
that the binary representation of 0 should be 0.
