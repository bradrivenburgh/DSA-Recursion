// Fibonacci Sequence
/*
What is the input to the program?
  A number greater than zero
What is the output of the program?
  An array with the Fibonacci sequence of a given number (the position in the sequence)
  e.g., for 7 it would be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
What is the input to each recursive call?
  
What is the output of each recursive call?
